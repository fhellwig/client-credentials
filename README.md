# client-credentials

Provides the access token for Azure Active Directory (AAD) resources using client credentials.

Version 1.1.1

Exports the `ClientCredentials` class that provides the `getAccessToken` method. The mechanism by which the access token is obtained is described by the [Service to Service Calls Using Client Credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-service-to-service) article.

## 1. Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save client-credentials
```

## 2. Usage

```javascript
const ClientCredentials = require('client-credentials');

const credentials = new ClientCredentials('my-company.com', 'client-id', 'client-secret');

credentials.getAccessToken('https://my-resource.com').then(token => {
  console.log('Access Token', token);
})
```

You can request access tokens for any number of resources. The tokens are cached and refreshed automatically.

## 3. API

### 3.1 constructor

```javascript
ClientCredentials(tenant, clientId, clientSecret)
```

Creates a new `ClientCredentials` instance for the specified `tenant`. The `clientId` and the `clientSecret` must be for an AAD application that has access rights to the resource specified as the first parameter to the `getAccessToken` method.

### 3.2 getAccessToken

```javascript
getAccessToken(resource)
```

Gets the access token for the specified resource. If no token exists in the token cache, it is requested from the Microsoft login service at `login.microsoftonline.com`. This method returns a promise that is resolved with the access token.
